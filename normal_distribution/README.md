# Normal Distribution Learning Package

A comprehensive, hands-on guide to learning about normal distributions and probability through code and visualizations.

## üìö Overview

This package contains five interactive modules that build your understanding from basic concepts to advanced analysis:

1. **basics.py** - Normal Distribution Fundamentals
2. **central_limit_theorem.py** - The Central Limit Theorem
3. **standard_normal.py** - Z-scores and Standardization
4. **analysis.py** - Testing for Normality
5. **visualizer.py** - Interactive GUI Explorer

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Interactive Menu (Recommended)

The easiest way to explore all modules:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python src/normal_distribution/main.py
```

This presents an interactive menu to select which module to run.

### Run Individual Modules

```bash
# From the project root directory
python src/normal_distribution/basics.py
python src/normal_distribution/central_limit_theorem.py
python src/normal_distribution/standard_normal.py
python src/normal_distribution/analysis.py
python src/normal_distribution/visualizer.py
```

Each module can be run independently to focus on specific concepts.

## üí° Tips for Learning

1. **Run the code yourself** - Don't just read, execute each module and examine the outputs
2. **Modify parameters** - Change values in the code to see how results differ
3. **Save the plots** - All modules save plots as PNG files for later reference
4. **Use the visualizer** - The interactive tool helps build intuition
5. **Read the comments** - Each file has extensive educational comments
6. **Try the exercises** - Modify the examples to test your understanding

## üìù Additional Resources

### Key Formulas

**Normal Distribution PDF:**
```
f(x) = (1 / (œÉ‚àö(2œÄ))) * e^(-((x-Œº)¬≤) / (2œÉ¬≤))
```

**Z-Score (Standardization):**
```
z = (x - Œº) / œÉ
```

**Standard Error:**
```
SE = œÉ / ‚àön
```

**Reverse Z-Score:**
```
x = Œº + z √ó œÉ
```

### Important Values
